Instructions on how to build to importer:

Make sure you have at least, a newer version of the mysql server on your machine before compile.
Any version from 4.1.x or 5.x will work. On red hat, or fedora systems, make sure you have the
mysql-devel packages installed. MySQL 4.0.x and older does not have support for precompiled statements.
You will also need the zlib package installed on your machine. zlib is used to import compressed logs, and
also for the mysql client.
The configure script will check if your MySQL client support prepared statements.


Uncompress the source tree in any directory:

	tar xzvf mysar-importer-2.12.0.x.tar.gz

After decompress, enter the folder and run the configure script. By default, the Autoconf & Automake scripts
install the files in /usr/local/bin and /usr/local/etc.

	./configure

if you want to install the files in a different location, like /usr/bin and /etc use the following command line:

	./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc

and then compile the package.

	make

should compile nice, and no errors displayed. Warnings can be ignored.
Then as root, do the install:

	make install
	or
	sudo make install

That's is, the binary and the configuration file will be installed.
Now edit the configuration where you specified: by default is on /usr/local/etc

	vi /usr/local/etc/mysar.conf

The conf file has the explanation of All items inside, and is easy to understand. The file keeps mysql 
credentials, squid logfile path and the application PID path. Set up the config file, save and run the importer.
if anything goes work, it will warn you.

When running, it will show nothing on screen. if you want to see some progress, use the --stats command line.
When finished, it will show the number of lines imported, ignored, and broken count.


			** Some Command Line parameters **

Mysar support both long and short command line parameters. Below is a brief of each command.
Command line switches have priority over global configuration. If the value is set on the
configuration file, and is disabled at command line, the value from configuration will be ignored.

--resolver			this enables the DNS resolver
--noresolver			this disables the DNS resolver
--traffic			enable full traffic import from logfile
--notraffic			disable full traffic import. navigation details wont be imported.
--zip 		<file>		load a gzipped logfile for importing.
--logfile 	<file>		load a different plain text logfile.
--debug				enable some debug functionality. useful to find obscure problems.
--config 	<file>		load an alternative configuration file, instead of /etc/mysar.conf
--help				show the help, with command line options.
--generatedb			shows the database creator. create or replace MySAR databases.
--stats				show records status when importing.
--optimizedb			force database optimize. the importer quits afer finish.
--quiet				does not show any message. all error messages are logged within syslog.
--kill				send a kill signal to a running importer. the running importer will shutdown
				and save its runtime states. the new launched importer will continue the job.

--groupdomains			group domains on the site viewer. instead of showing each URL for the domain,
				it will sum all traffic size, and display the main domain on site viewer.
				details will show its sub-domains, and so on.

--offline			this will make the importer read the log file, and do not check for timestamps.
				useful when importing old logfiles. It will not update any timestamps from the
				last import. It will only insert data on the database and quit. be careful
				to not import twice the same file, or all traffic and summaries will be duplicated!

				For offline mode work, you should specify a logfile. can be either plain text, or
				gzipped. If you dont specify --zip or --logfile it will not run, and show an error.


QUICK NOTES:

The database optimizer will run when the number of days specified on "keep" days is reached. for example:
If you set 32 days on the "keep days" at the administration panel, it will optimize the DB at every 32 days.
The optimize is not necessary to run every day, or every week. At least one month is okay.

If you hit CTRL-C during a manual import, mysar will save its progress. if you run it again, it will start
where stoppped. no traffic will be duplicated.

If you want to stop a cron job, or an importer that is running, use the --kill switch. the current running
importer will halt, and the new launched will take control.


			** Thanks Section **

I would like to thanks Giannis Stoilis for creating mysar. This program is all based on his work.
Thanks to Tomas France for testing the beta versions, and for bug reporting
